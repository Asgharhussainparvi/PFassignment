'''Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers.
Given two integer numbers, return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than
1000. Otherwise, return their sum.'''

num1 = 303
num2 = 20
product  = num1*num2
if product <= 1000:
   print(num1*num2)
else:
     print(num1 + num2)
